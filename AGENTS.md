# Clawster

## Purpose
AI desktop pet for macOS — an animated lobster that lives on your screen, watches what you're doing, and helps you via tool calling, screen analysis, and memory. Electron app with React renderer, hybrid local + cloud AI architecture.

## For AI Agents

### Architecture Overview
```
User message
  ├─ Local model (Qwen, fine-tuned, via Ollama) → tool classification
  ├─ Cloud proxy (Cloudflare Worker → GPT-4o-mini) → conversation + vision
  └─ Memory layer (SQLite via better-sqlite3) → facts + emotional memories
```

### Working In This Directory
- Main process code is in `src/main/`, renderer in `src/renderer/`
- The proxy is a separate Cloudflare Worker in `proxy/` with its own `package.json`
- HMAC authentication links the client and proxy (shared secret)
- Local model requires Ollama running at `localhost:11434`
- Electron's native `win.setPosition(x, y)` throws a hard `TypeError` ("Error processing argument at index N, conversion failure") on any argument V8 doesn't treat as an Int32 — NaN, ±Infinity, non-integers, and **negative zero**. The CLA-56 crash was `-0`: an unclamped drag parked the pet above the top edge (negative y), and `Math.round` in the move animation returned `-0` on frames easing across zero (`-0` passes `Number.isFinite`). Guard coords with `areUsableCoords` (`pet-behaviors.ts`), normalize with `+ 0` before the native sink, and clamp drags via `clampPetPosition` (`windows.ts`). Note the store cannot be poisoned with NaN (`JSON.stringify(NaN)` is `null`), but `resolvePetStartPosition` still guards startup against `Infinity` (`1e999` parses as Infinity) and partial/stringified legacy values
- Renderer behavior that needs unit tests lives in pure logic modules (no React/Electron imports) next to the component, e.g. `src/renderer/pet/emote-bubbles.ts` — the Vitest suite runs in a node environment with no DOM
- Main broadcasts companion-window visibility to the pet window on the `pet-ui-visibility` channel (chatbar/pet-chat/assistant show+hide+close, plus once on pet-window load); the pet uses it for the chatbar→curious mood (CLA-27) and emote-bubble suppression (CLA-13)
- The `pet.muted` setting (Assistant panel toggle) silences both of Clawster's sound sources (CLA-52). Main pushes changes to the **pet-chat** window on the `pet-muted-changed` channel — that window owns the Animalese engine, so sending to the pet window would never gate the voice — and `main.ts` calls `setMutedProvider` so `chat/tool-executor.ts` can raise notifications with `silent: true`. The engine seeds itself from persisted settings on the first utterance and applies later changes mid-utterance; character timing is unchanged when muted

### Voice Input (local Whisper STT)
- `native/speech-helper/main.swift` captures the mic and transcribes on-device with whisper.cpp — no audio leaves the machine. It speaks the same line-delimited JSON protocol as before (`start`/`stop`/`quit` on stdin → `status`/`partial`/`final`/`error` on stdout), so `src/main/speech.ts`, the `speech-start`/`speech-stop` IPC, and the renderer are all unchanged
- `npm run build:speech` downloads the prebuilt whisper.cpp **xcframework** (pinned version + sha256) into `native/speech-helper/vendor/`. Using the release artifact keeps this a `swiftc`-only build — **no cmake needed**. Both the framework and the binary are gitignored
- The helper is linked with two rpaths so one binary resolves `whisper.framework` in both layouts: in dev the script copies the framework next to `native/speech-helper/speech-helper` (`@executable_path`), and a packaged app ships it to `Contents/Frameworks/whisper.framework` via electron-builder's `mac.extraFiles` (`@executable_path/../Frameworks`, since the helper itself lands in `Contents/Resources/` via `extraResources`). Nested frameworks must live under `Contents/Frameworks/` for `codesign` to accept the bundle
- The framework is built for **macOS 13.3**, so the helper targets 13.3 and `speech-start` rejects older systems with a clear message
- The ~148 MB model (`ggml-base.en.bin`) is **never committed or bundled**. It downloads on first voice use into `<clawsterDataDir()>/models/whisper/`, checksum-verified via a `.part` temp file. While it downloads, `speech-start` returns a "Setting up voice…" message that the chatbar already renders — no renderer changes needed
- Whisper hallucinates confident phrases from room tone, so the helper only transcribes when RMS-based voice activity was detected, and `sanitizeTranscript()` (`src/main/whisper-transcript.ts`) strips `[BLANK_AUDIO]`-style annotations
- ggml's Metal backend aborts at exit if a whisper context is still alive — every exit path must call `WhisperEngine.shutdown()` first

### Testing Requirements
- `npm test` — Vitest unit tests (no external services needed)
- `npm run test:e2e` — Playwright E2E (needs Vite dev server + optionally Ollama)
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — Type checking
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on PRs and pushes to `staging`: a `test` job (type check + full Vitest suite) and a separate `safety` job (child-safety tests: `test/safety-filter.test.ts`, `test/open-url-safety.test.ts`)

### Build & Release
- `npm run dist:mac` — Build + notarize for macOS
- Tag `vX.Y.Z` and push to trigger CI release via GitHub Actions
- Auto-update via `electron-updater` checks GitHub Releases

### Testing Gotchas
- Use `vi.mock('electron')`, never `vi.doMock` — known Vitest bug (#4166) leaves exports undefined
- Unit tests that route through `executeTool` (e.g. via `ChatRouter.chat`) must also `vi.mock('child_process')` — otherwise `tool-executor.ts` runs real `osascript` against macOS apps, which can stall under parallel test load (see `test/quick-replies.test.ts`)
- Integration tests (`test/e2e-*.test.ts`) need Ollama running — they skip gracefully if unavailable
- `test/speech-helper.test.ts` drives the real Swift helper binary; it skips unless macOS + `npm run build:speech` has run + the Whisper model is downloaded. It synthesizes speech with `say` rather than needing a microphone
- E2E tests use `CLAWSTER_DATA_DIR` env var to isolate test data from real user data
- E2E specs save screenshots when the `EVIDENCE_DIR` env var is set (skipped otherwise) — evidence for PR review is committed under `.no-mistakes/evidence/`

### Model Conversion Pipeline
When fine-tuning a new local model:
1. HuggingFace safetensors → GGUF F16 (via `llama.cpp/convert_hf_to_gguf.py`)
2. GGUF F16 → Q4_K_M quantization (via `llama-quantize`)
3. Register with Ollama via `Modelfile` → `ollama create`
4. Training data in `eval/train-data/` (JSONL format)
